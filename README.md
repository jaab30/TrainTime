# TrainTime

This is a simple Web appliccation to calculate when the next train is coming by entering the train's first departure time and the frequency of the train's next departures. 
I used Firebase to store my results and moment JS to format and to make the time calculations.

Web Tools:  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase.
